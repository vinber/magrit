- Fix badly set value on some input range elements.


0.7.2 (2018-03-19)
------------------

- Removes arithmetic progression classification method.

- Also allow to create proportionnal symbols map when analyzing a layer of points.

- Allow to use rounded corners on rectangles available as layout features.

- Slightly change the behavior when a result layer is added by not fitting anymore the viewport on it.

- Fix the "fit-zoom" behavior when using Armadillo projection and a layer at world scale.

0.7.0 (2018-03-05)
------------------

- New: allow to analyze a layer of points by two means : through a regular grid or through an existing layer of polygons. Informations computed are either the density of items (weighted or not) in each cell/polygon or a statistical summary (mean or standard deviation) about the items belonging to each cell/polygon.


0.6.7 (2018-02-01)
------------------

- Fix links creation on some cases when using integers as identifiers.

0.6.5 (2018-01-12)
------------------

- Be more tolerant with in the regular expression used to filter the name of exported maps (by allowing dot, dash and parantheses for example).

- Fix the displaying of the "waiting" overlay when loading a TopoJSON layer.

- Fix the displaying of the "horizontal layout" option for legend when used on a categorical choropleth map + rounding precision for "horizontal layout" legend and "proportionnal symbols" legend.

------------------

- Slightly change how field type is determined.

- Try to improve the 'active'/'pushed' effect on buttons located on the bottom-right of the map.

- Try to be lighter on the use of memory (by reducing the TTL of redis entries and by not saving (for later reuse) intermediate results anymore when computing potentials).

- Explicitly set locale and language parameters on docker image and make a better sanitizing of layer names.


0.6.3 (2017-12-14)
------------------

- Fix encoding issue of some sample basemaps (introduced in 0.6.1).

0.6.2 (2017-12-12)
------------------

0.6.1 (2017-12-11)
------------------

- New: add a new kind of layout for legends in use for choropleth maps.

0.6.0 (2017-11-29)
------------------

- New: add some new basemaps for France.


0.5.7 (2017-11-08)
------------------

- Fix minors typo in french translation.

- Fix bug preventing to modify the number of class when using a diverging classification scheme.


0.5.6 (2017-10-31)
------------------

- Fix bug with projection rotation properties not applied when reloading a project file.


0.5.5 (2017-10-12)
------------------

- Fix bug with pictogram displaying in the appropriate box.


0.5.4 (2017-10-01)
------------------

- Change the default font used in text/tspan SVG elements (in favor of verdana). Should fix (for real this time?) the bug occuring while trying to open the resulting SVG file with some software on systems where the font in use is not available (notably Adobe Illustrator v16.0 CS6 on MacOSX).

- Disable the ability to use sphere and graticule with lambert conic conformal projection (the generated path, which is currently not clipped when using Proj4 projections, could be very heavy due to the conical nature of the projection).

- Allow to cancel the ongoing addition of a layout item by pressing Esc (and so inform the user about that in the notification).

- Improve the legend for proportionnal symbols (only for "single color" ones) by also using the stroke color of the result layer in the legend.

- Add "Bertin 1953" projection to the list of available projections.


0.5.3 (2017-09-22)
------------------

- Change the default font used in text/tspan SVG elements (in favor of Arial). Should fix the bug occuring while trying to open the resulting SVG file with some software on systems where the font in use is not available (notably Adobe Illustrator v16.0 CS6 on MacOSX).


0.5.2 (2017-09-13)
------------------

- Fix graticule style edition.


0.5.1 (2017-09-08)

------------------

- Allow to create, use (and re-use) custom palette for choropleth maps.

- Allow to hide/display the head of arrows.

- Notable change: some old project-files may no longer be loaded correctly (the impact is really quite limited, but precisely, the overlay order of layout features could be incorrect when opening these old project-files).

- Fix error with legend customization box after changing the layer name.

- Re-allow to display the table of the joined dataset and improve the table layout.

- Improve handling of fields containing mixed numerical and not numerical values for some representations.


0.4.1 (2017-08-14)

- Change the overlay displayed when a layer is loading.


0.4.0 (2017-07-24)

------------------

- Fix error on jointure.

- Fix legend size on links and discontinuities when zooming.


0.3.6 (2017-06-30)

- New: Allow to change the name of the layers at any time.


0.3.3 (2017-06-15)
------------------

- Allow to add more than one sphere background (#26).

- Add default projection for sample basemaps.


0.3.2 (2017-06-09)
------------------

- Fix text annotation behavior when clicking on "cancel".
